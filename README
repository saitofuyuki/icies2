 IcIES-2/README
================

This is Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies II (IcIES-2), a three-dimensional
numerical ice-sheet model that is developed under collaboration between Japan Agency for
Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) and Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute,
University of Tokyo (AORI).

The Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies (the original IcIES, hereafter referred to
as IcIES-1) is another numerical ice-sheet model which has been developed under the same
collaboration.  As a successor of IcIES-1, IcIES-2 partially inherits the philosophy of IcIES-1,
however, IcIES-2 is a completely different model that has been developed from a scratch.  IcIES-2
shares nothing with IcIES-1, including source codes, scripts, documents, and also the license and
policy.  Please do not mixture IcIES-2 and IcIES-1.

In all of the resources in this package, a word `IcIES' indicates IcIES-2 even without the suffix,
while IcIES-1 is always explicitly mentioned.
