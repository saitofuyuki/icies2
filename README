This is IcIES-2/JP, a subset of Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies II (IcIES-2).
IcIES-2 is a three-dimensional numerical ice-sheet model, introduced in the following section.

IcIES-2/JP is a 1d numerical ice-sheet dating model, which is developed under the IcIES-2 framework
and design.  Most subroutines in IcIES-2 are not used in IcIES-2/JP, however, they are included in
this package to avoid complexity.

IcIES-2/JP is still under development.  Version 0 is somewhat an intermediate stage for
a major release, however, it is released for recording and archiving purposes.
In the next revision, it will be more simplified to achieve less dependency on IcIES-2.

See the next section for introduction of IcIES-2.
See INSTALL-icies2 for specific installation instructions for IcIES-2/JP.
See HOWTORUN for brief description of experiment scripts and outputs.

 IcIES-2/README
================

This is Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies II (IcIES-2), a three-dimensional
numerical ice-sheet model that is developed under collaboration between Japan Agency for
Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) and Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute,
University of Tokyo (AORI).

The Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies (the original IcIES, hereafter referred to
as IcIES-1) is another numerical ice-sheet model which has been developed under the same
collaboration.  As a successor of IcIES-1, IcIES-2 partially inherits the philosophy of IcIES-1,
however, IcIES-2 is a completely different model that has been developed from a scratch.  IcIES-2
shares nothing with IcIES-1, including source codes, scripts, documents, and also the license and
policy.  Please do not mixture IcIES-2 and IcIES-1.

In all of the resources in this package, a word `IcIES' indicates IcIES-2 even without the suffix,
while IcIES-1 is always explicitly mentioned.

 Addendum

Development stages, releases, and distribution of IcIES-2 (and IcIES-1) are codenamed after the
Peanuts characters.  See https://www.google.com/search?q=Jose+Peterson+Peanuts to learn about JP
(which stands for Jose Peterson, a player in Peppermint Patty's baseball team).
