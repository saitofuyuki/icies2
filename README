This is IcIES-2(SNPY), version 0.97, an beta version of Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system
Studies II (IcIES-2).  IcIES-2 is a three-dimensional numerical ice-sheet model, introduced in the
following section.

IcIES-2(SNPY) 0.97 is a preliminary stage for a major release of IcIES(SNPY) version 1.0, however,
it is released for recording and archiving purposes.  In the next revision, the structure will be
more efficient.

See the next section for introduction of IcIES-2.
See INSTALL-icies2 for specific installation instructions for IcIES-2(SNPY).

 IcIES-2/README
================

This is Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies II (IcIES-2), a three-dimensional
numerical ice-sheet model that is developed under collaboration between Japan Agency for
Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) and Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute,
University of Tokyo (AORI).

The Ice sheet model for Integrated Earth system Studies (the original IcIES, hereafter referred to
as IcIES-1) is another numerical ice-sheet model which has been developed under the same
collaboration.  As a successor of IcIES-1, IcIES-2 partially inherits the philosophy of IcIES-1,
however, IcIES-2 is a completely different model that has been developed from a scratch.  IcIES-2
shares nothing with IcIES-1, including source codes, scripts, documents, and also the license and
policy.  Please do not mixture IcIES-2 and IcIES-1.

In all of the resources in this package, a word `IcIES' indicates IcIES-2 even without the suffix,
while IcIES-1 is always explicitly mentioned.

 Addendum

Development stages, releases, and distribution of IcIES-2 (and IcIES-1) are codenamed after the
Peanuts characters.  See https://www.google.com/search?q=Snoopy+Peanuts to learn about SNPY
(which stands for Snoopy, the world's most famous beagle).
