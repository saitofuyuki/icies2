Initialization
==============

Initialization by external files is now implemented, but this is just
a makeshift way.

Prepare initial thickness and bedrock files in the format of one-value
by one-line style.  Do not forget to specify number of grids in x- and
y-direction at ``IX`` and ``IY`` in the namelist ``NITAMI``,
respectively.
